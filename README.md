# Study-AutoMate
An Open-AI powered flashcard generator for study purposes.

# How It Works
Users can upload a PDF file of their written notes by clicking on the 'upload file' button. Once completed, a prompt including the written notes will be passed by an OpenAI API call and a series of questions and answers will be written to a downloadable CSV file to which the user can download and upload to any applicable flashcard app for efficient study.
